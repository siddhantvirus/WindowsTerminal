My personal profile settings is use for Windows Terminal Preview


I've added the following shortcuts currently supported by Windows Terminal Preview , which make using a command line much easier.

|       Command      |    Key Binding   |
|:------------------:|:----------------:|
|       New Tab      |      Ctrl+T      |
|  Close Current Tab |      Ctrl+W      |
|     Split Pane     |  Alt + Shift + D |  
| Close Current Pane | Ctrl + Shift + W |


The Split Pane Shortcut is been set by Default by Microsoft and ```Ctrl + Shift + T ``` also opens a new Tab.
